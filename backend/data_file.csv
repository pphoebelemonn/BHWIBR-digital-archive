3rd chinese adoptee symposium reflections,"3rd Chinese Adoptee Symposium: 落叶归根 [Falling Leaves Return to Their Roots]  I often try to intellectualize my adoptee experience, something I’ve learned only in the last 48 hours is a way of coping with the things that hurt us most.  It’s true—I write, I read, I code, I create, and I research about adoption and about China to try to make sense of it all. I have this fantasy that one day I’ll have published hundreds of peer-reviewed journals, been featured in renowned exhibitions, and produced the most groundbreaking research for all my family, friends, colleagues, enemies, and past lovers to see, and that when that day comes, they will finally know me, understand me, see me, and I will be happy. But perhaps deep down I chase this fantasy to cope with what I am too afraid to feel.  Sometimes, no amount of thinking can mend the pain, suffering, and heartbreak that being an adoptee is. It doesn’t explain why I find myself praying to every god I know, begging for a reshuffling of the cards I’ve been dealt. It doesn’t explain how adoption makes me feel simultaneously confused, grounded, stupid, smart, ugly, beautiful, ashamed, and proud all at once. I thought I knew what would make me happy—what would heal me—but actually, I don’t have the slightest idea.  At this year’s symposium, I asked myself to feel all of these things, without reaching into my back pocket of APA citations for help. I sobbed, I laughed, I told stories. I cut peppers into quarters. I allowed myself to have fun, and I allowed myself to grieve. I felt the comfort of reconnecting with old friends and the joy of making new ones. I got angry at the world for tearing us apart and then thanked it for bringing us together.  Like 落叶归根 suggests, I let myself fall and flow with the wind. I let myself hit the ground. I let myself wither and seep into the soil. For once, I stop fighting and let gravity take over. I rest.",[],2025-05-30T13:54:37.395077,0ccdd308-7b34-429f-9cc5-db7f238d8248,None,POSITIVE,toxic,None
