            "text": "I identify more with American culture, but I think that is because I am a\nforeigner living in China. If I was back home in Charlotte, NC, I may feel\nexcluded from the culture at times. Even watching from afar on social media, I\nsee how I identify less and less with my hometown and more with the people\naround me (who also look more like me). I think being an adoptee has at times\ndefinitely made it hard feeling close to Asian or Chinese-American culture\nbecause I didn\u2019t grow up in Asian environments. I didn\u2019t have Asian family\nmembers, so some of the commonalities many Asians have I feel left out of.\nStill, I look Chinese and when a stranger sees me at first glance, they don\u2019t\nknow my upbringing or background, so I am subject to discrimination just like\nany other Asian looking person, so there is some solidarity in that. I may have\ndifferent life experiences than other Asians, but there is still a strong sense of\nChineseness or Asianness that can\u2019t be stripped away even though I am\nadopted.\nWhat emotions/th",

            "text": "As an adoptee, I\u2019ve always had a broad definition of family as something that can cross\nbiological ties. I consider close friends and pets as family. At times, I feel a bit left out when\npeople talk about how they\u2019re able to trace their genetic lineage more extensively since that\u2019s\nsomething I can\u2019t really do. When I hear people talk about ancestors I think it\u2019s something I\u2019m\nbetter able to relate to since, in my mind, the ancestors from my biological family sort of\nconceptually transcend geographic barriers. The idea of ancestors makes me feel a bit more\nconnected to my biological family in a sense.\n\nOverall, I don\u2019t think being an adoptee has largely affected my relationships with my\nclose family members. My parents were always open to talking about adoption with both my\nsister and I growing up. They made sure that we knew it was and still is okay to want to ask\nquestions and have a variety of emotions about being adopted. One family relationship that\u2019s\nbeen important for me as an adoptee is with my aunt. She\u2019s from China and I learned a lot about\nChina through her. I\u2019d say that relationship really helped me become more interested in my\nChinese heritage and the culture.",

I think now seeing more and more Asians\nrepresented in media is great because I feel like our collective identities are being\nrecognized, but also every story is unique and our differences are celebrated. I\nalso feel extremely privileged to have only worked for Asian women since I\ngraduated from NYU Shanghai. It is so inspiring to have someone who looks like\nyou as a role model every day and to feel confident that you can be in their shoes\none day. Of course this is because these individuals are actually great leaders and\nnot just Asian women, but it does help that I feel a connection to them. I worry\nthat if I return to the US, I wouldn\u2019t feel as empowered in my workplace.\n\nHmmm I am so lazy all things hair/fashion/makeup haha. My mom didn\u2019t let me\nuse eyeliner or mascara growing up because my eyes are different and my\neyelashes kinda fold in. This didn\u2019t upset me or anything, but it feels kinda silly\nlike my white mom trying to protect her special Chinese baby haha. She also\nnever made me eat cereal because she worried I was lactose intolerant. Anyways,\nI\u2019m not big into makeup but that\u2019s really just my personal choice. I don\u2019t feel like\nI adopt Asian trends, but I do love Uniqlo!

Generally, I feel like Asian American culture is most relatable or identifiable for me\nbecause there\u2019s so many other Asian Americans and adoptees have shared experiences within the\nculture. In my experience, I think being an adoptee adds more complexity when it comes to\ncertain cultural identifications, though I don\u2019t think it makes it too difficult to identify within a\nculture. I think when you\u2019re growing up as an adoptee there isn\u2019t always a big focus on the fact\nthat you\u2019re adopted so you\u2019re able to take part in certain cultures more freely.\n\nI get irritated and frustrated when I hear adoptees being referred to as such because it\nimplies that we had a choice in how we were raised and in which communities we were raised in.\nIt also just illustrates the expectations others impose on us just for being Chinese. For me, I think\npeople calling adoptees or other Asian Americans in general \u201cwhite-washed\u201d or \u201ctoo Chinese\u201d or\n\u201cnot Chinese enough\u201d also shows how the idea of being Chinese differs for so many people. I\u2019ve\nbeen called white-washed plenty of times and my response is usually along the lines of \u201cWell,\nyeah. My whole family is white, it\u2019s kind of unavoidable.\u201d",

Due to that, I think I was more open to learning more about Asian\n(Chinese) culture. As far as seeing people that looked like me or had similar experiences as me in\nthe media while growing up, it was something I didn\u2019t realize was lacking until movies and\nshows with Asians as central characters started coming out more recently. The first time I really\nnoticed this was after I watched the movie To All the Boys I Loved Before, which has a female\nAsian American lead. On top of that, the actress who plays that role was also adopted! This\ndefinitely highlighted the lack of representation in film, TV, social media, etc. I experienced\ngrowing up. Now there\u2019s been a significant increase of people who look like me in the media as a\nwhole, which truly just makes me feel seen and more validated in terms of identity.",

Because I wouldn\u2019t say that someone\u2019s family that\nimmigrated to America from Germany in the 1400s is also culturally German. For\nadoptees this definition would make sense because many of us grew up in\nAmerican culture but want to understand their \u201cbirth culture.\u201d So culture to me is\ndifferent from my hometown community because their culture is just American\nbut because of the adoptee's complicated beginnings, culture means much more.",

As a child, I never asked for this type of scrutiny and it\nmade me withdraw heavily into myself when I was around classmates and my\nparents.

This was one of many challenges that I\u2019ve faced, but it\u2019s an\nunfortunate one because I felt as though my home was my safe space and I\ndidn\u2019t let anyone in.\nAnother challenge that I\u2019ve faced concerns how I process race-related\nsuffering.

My mom was always\nvery intentional in being open with our adoption stories and would tell them over and over\nagain whenever we asked to hear them. Ever since I can remember, she would read this\nchildren\u2019s book called \u201cI Love You Like Crazy Cakes\u201d about a woman who travels to China\nto adopt her daughter. I personally think that book was a very good decision and I\nappreciate having heard it over and over again. Despite all of us being adopted, my cousins\nand sister and I never talked about it. It was never really a conversation in our house.\nMaybe it felt like we\u2019d talked it to death as young children and we were content with\npretending it didn\u2019t exist anymore.

I honestly don\u2019t think my family did anything particularly wrong. They didn\u2019t push either\nidentity on me. I remember one year, my mom printed off coloring sheets and ordered\nChinese food for my kindergarten class on Chinese New Year Day.

            "text": "I often try to intellectualize my adoptee experience, something only learned in last 48 hours is a way of coping with the things that hurt us most. I write, I read, I code, I create, and I research about adoption and about China to try to make sense of it all. I have this fantasy that one day I\u2019ll have written hundreds of peer-reviewed journals, been featured in the most renowned exhibitions, and produced the most ground-breaking research for all my family, friends, colleagues, past lovers, and enemies to see, and that when that day comes, they will finally see me, and I will be happy. I\\u2019m beginning to realize that perhaps deep down I chase this fantasy to cope with the things I am too afraid to feel. \\n\\nBut sometimes, no amount of thinking can mend the pain, suffering, and heartbreak that being an adoptee is. It doesn\u2019t explain why I sometimes pray to every god I know begging for a reshuffling of the cards I\u2019ve been dealt. It doesn\u2019t explain how adoption makes me feel simultaneously confused, grounded, stupid, smart, ugly, beautiful, ashamed, and proud all at once. I thought I knew what would make me happy-what would heal me-but actually, I don\u2019t have the slightest idea. At this year\u2019s symposium, I asked myself to feel all of these things, without reaching into my back pocket of terminologies and APA citations for help. I sobbed, I laughed, I told stories. I allowed myself to have fun, and I allowed myself to grieve. I felt the comfort of reconnecting with old friends and the joy of making new ones. I got angry at the world for tearing us apart and then thanked it for bringing us together. Like \u843d\u53f6\u5f52\u6839 suggests, I let myself fall and flow with the wind. I let myself hit the ground. I let myself wither and seep into the soil. For once, I stop fighting and let gravity take over. I rest.",

They ought to feel lucky to be a part of their lives. And in return, adoptive parents ought to be, well, good adoptive parents: they ought to see their child as their own, and they ought to support their child in their adoptee journey in any way that they can. Once these boxes have been ticked, criticism towards the adoptive parent and their methods ought to be completely out of line and seen as a sign of \u201cdisrespect\u201d or \u201cungratefulness\u201d. \n\nThis is not to say that I didn\u2019t meet this expectation, I did very much so fit into this box, especially growing up. \n\nBut as I grow older and I begin to have thoughts and experiences that they could never even imagine, suddenly that unconditional support I felt as a kid, is no longer there.\n\nI feel myself drifting farther and farther apart from my parents, and I \nThe rose tinted glasses have come off, and I\u2019ve grown to see my parents as not the perfect adoptive parents I once believed they were. But that is okay. We as adoptees need to realize that no matter how much we want to deny and avoid it, no matter how much we tell ourselves and those around us that yes, these Are are real parents and we wouldn\u2019t trade them for the world, that there is always going to be a disconnect, a strain in our relationship that biological children will NEVER experience with their parents. It\u2019s a feeling of unfamiliarity, of betrayal that the people you love so much might not be able to support your identity in the way that you wish. It\u2019s that pit in your stomach that forms when you come home after months or years and feel like you are talking to strangers.\n\n\nYou still feel alone because it\u2019s your own parents, the one two people in your life who you love and care for with all your heart, have betrayed you, by exhisting as white parents and refusing to acknowledge that their whiteness could and will harm their child. With zero ties to you or your heritage, it feels like betrayal when my parents chose to live in absolutely bum fuck no where, to send me to a private school with all white kids, to only be surrounded by their white-collar friends who were all white, who were all doctors, and who all had white, privileged kids. \n",

I didn\u2019t have Asian family members, so some of the commonalities many Asians have I feel left out of. Still, I look Chinese and when a stranger sees me at first glance, they don\u2019t  know my upbringing or background, so I am subject to discrimination just like any other Asian looking person, so there is some solidarity in that.

            "title": "My thoughts on 'being in the fog'",
            "text": "There are two main viewpoints on adoption. The first, more commonly understood one, is that adoption is the altruistic act of helping a child in need, giving them a better life than they would have had if they weren\u2019t adopted. This is what the adoption industry wants you to believe. This is what most people in your life want you to believe. This is what so many adoptive parents want you to believe. \n\tThe second viewpoint, is the one I would hope that by the end of reading this, you can come to terms with, which is that adoption is not an individual act of                                             mc , but a carefully calculated transaction of human capital, part of a larger, global network that is used as a tool of modern day colonialism and white supremacy. This is the perspective that no one wants to talk about. This is the perspective that gets people looking at you like you\u2019re crazy. This is the perspective that is so incredibly hard to digest. \n\tOf course, one could say that these two perspectives are the two extremes of a much wider, diverse, range of perspectives out there. It could be said that making sense of one\u2019s own adoption is as much as it is a rocky road as it is a spectrum, with the two extremes being on either end of it. The unfortunate thing is, while I would love for revery adoptee out there to be able to understand how turbulent, traumatic, and inherently problematic adoption is, it\u2019s an opinion that most consider too radical to even consider. Not every adoptee will reach this point ever in their life, and if they do, there\u2019s no telling how long it will take. Moreover, there are so many factors that play into the likelihood and the timeframe of an adoptee\u2019s journey out of The Fog. For example, the town in which one grew up in, how open one\u2019s parents are about adoption, their relationship and proximity to other Chinese people, their knowledge of adoption, are just some of the many factors that play a role in an adoptee\u2019s discovery of their past. Of course, I also strongly believe that it also has to do with the personality of an adoptee, regardless of external factors. All adoptees, just like non-adoptees, are so different from one another, and will have different experiences no matter what. \n\tIn my experience, I grew up with parents who, for the most part, were incredibly supportive of who I was as an adoptee. They took me to Chinese school, let me learn Chinese, travelled with me to China, etc. Whether they\u2019ve been able to accept the responsibility and take restorative action for the trauma they have caused me\u2014that\u2019s a different story that I discuss in a different chapter. Though all in all, I would say I finally got out of being in the fog when I was a freshman in college, and since then, I\u2019ve been constantly reflecting on, criticizing, researching, and questioning my upbringing, trying to realign my past and present so that I can continue to work through the trauma in my life. \n",

And while this blanket statement was helpful during my adolescence when I was constantly dealing with people asking me with a condescending glare, \u201cwho are your REAL parents?\u201d, now this type of rhetoric seems to do more harm than good. Because as you grow older you begin to be able to formulate and vocalize real, objective opinions about your parents; you gain a valuable perspective on the type of people your parents are, their values and morals. However, being adopted and coming from a relatively healthy childhood complicates this, because even now, though I\u2019m able to critically examine where my parents have \u201cgone wrong\u201d \u2014 not only as parents but as ADOPTIVE parents \u2014 , I find myself feeling guilty for having such opinions, because I\u2019ve been conditioned my whole life to believe that these are in fact my real parents and I should be eternally grateful for that. And so at almost 21 years old I\u2019m grappling with the reality that my parents and I view the world very differently\u2014socially, politically\u2014and a large part of that has to do with me being adopted, and a large part of me struggling to come to terms with that is the expectations that are set for adoptive parents and their children.
