When I hear people talk about ancestors I think it\u2019s something I\u2019m\nbetter able to relate to since, in my mind, the ancestors from my biological family sort of\nconceptually transcend geographic barriers. The idea of ancestors makes me feel a bit more\nconnected to my biological family in a sense.\n\nOverall, I don\u2019t think being an adoptee has largely affected my relationships with my\nclose family members. My parents were always open to talking about adoption with both my\nsister and I growing up. They made sure that we knew it was and still is okay to want to ask\nquestions and have a variety of emotions about being adopted. One family relationship that\u2019s\nbeen important for me as an adoptee is with my aunt. She\u2019s from China and I learned a lot about\nChina through her.

In my experience, I think being an adoptee adds more complexity when it comes to\ncertain cultural identifications, though I don\u2019t think it makes it too difficult to identify within a\nculture. I think when you\u2019re growing up as an adoptee there isn\u2019t always a big focus on the fact\nthat you\u2019re adopted so you\u2019re able to take part in certain cultures more freely.\n\nI get irritated and frustrated when I hear adoptees being referred to as such because it\nimplies that we had a choice in how we were raised and in which communities we were raised in.\nIt also just illustrates the expectations others impose on us just for being Chinese.

But the overall lack of not seeing East\nAsian people made me wish to be white as a kid because most of the people\nclose to me were white and attractive and popular. So I convinced myself that\nif only I was white I would be more popular and attractive. People definitely\nweren\u2019t mean to me but I could tell I wasn\u2019t really considered attractive and it\nwas hard for me to distinguish if it was because I was an awkward teen or\nAsian, maybe it was a bit of both. I think I kind of put my pretty, white\nfriends on a pedestal. Whenever I secretly got into K-Pop a few years ago I\nrealized that East Asia wasn\u2019t a place that adored white people and all their\nmedia wasn\u2019t eurocentric. The popularity of Asian media that began to rise\nmade me realize that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around America which\nshocked me because there\u2019s that saying that many people believe that\u2019s like\n\u201cWe\u2019re so lucky to be born here and live here because of all the freedom we\nget.\u201d These days, I feel like I am trying to cater to Asian beauty standards more\nthan Western. I feel like in America, I was performing for this culture by the\nway I dress and put on makeup, and I felt like I mastered it in a way. But now\nthat I\u2019m in China it\u2019s kinda putting me in an identity crisis because the\nstandards here are so different and I\u2019m often frustrated that I haven\u2019t been able\nto change to the Chinese aesthetic. It does take a toll on my self esteem here\nbecause I feel like the most ignorant American ever and I keep thinking about\nwhat it would\u2019ve been like to grow up in China and not feel so out of place.",

I used to feel really uncomfortable with this because while I\nviewed myself as their child and them as my parents, I would always get asked\nwhy they don\u2019t look like me, why they are so much older than me, or if they\nwere my neighbors. As a child, I never asked for this type of scrutiny and it\nmade me withdraw heavily into myself when I was around classmates and my\nparents. I felt embarrassed, burdened, and uncomfortable to have to be\nreminded of being abandoned with little vocabulary or knowledge to navigate\nor combat these feelings, so I think eventually I started to not have my friends\nbe around them and never brought people to my house; I would always go to\ntheirs. I think this type of defensiveness instilled at a young age made me\nbecome instinctively protective of my parents when people talk about them\nbecause I would constantly have to defend my reason for being here, existence,\nand identity. This was one of many challenges that I\u2019ve faced, but it\u2019s an\nunfortunate one because I felt as though my home was my safe space and I\ndidn\u2019t let anyone in.\nAnother challenge that I\u2019ve faced concerns how I process race-related\nsuffering. As I am becoming more and more aware of racial inequalities and\ninequities, along with systems of oppression, I have been faced with a certain\nlevel of cognitive dissonance. When I see or talk about traumatic events that\nare happening to the Asian-American community, I feel a level of fear, anger,\nand sadness but because of my identity, I often feel like I have not suffered\nenough to be allowed to feel these emotions, so I\u2019m left feeling helpless to my\nown emotions. While I look like those who were and are being targeted, I have\nfeatures in my personality, the way I speak, and privilege of a white person\nthat I\u2019m only beginning to unpack.",

Three of my cousins\nwere also adopted, one from the Philippines and two were domestic US adoptions.\nAdoption was actually quite normalized in my family because of that. My mom was always\nvery intentional in being open with our adoption stories and would tell them over and over\nagain whenever we asked to hear them. Ever since I can remember, she would read this\nchildren\u2019s book called \u201cI Love You Like Crazy Cakes\u201d about a woman who travels to China\nto adopt her daughter. I personally think that book was a very good decision and I\nappreciate having heard it over and over again. Despite all of us being adopted, my cousins\nand sister and I never talked about it. It was never really a conversation in our house.\nMaybe it felt like we\u2019d talked it to death as young children and we were content with\npretending it didn\u2019t exist anymore. It\u2019s not as if I felt like I needed or wanted to talk about it,\neither. I was more than happy trying to blend in as a \u2018normal\u2019 person. I think it\u2019s interesting\ntalking to other adoptees and asking how much their adoption was talked about over the\nyears within their families. I honestly don\u2019t think my family did anything particularly wrong. They didn\u2019t push either\nidentity on me. I remember one year, my mom printed off coloring sheets and ordered\nChinese food for my kindergarten class on Chinese New Year Day. At the time, I didn\u2019t really\nunderstand the significance and I was just happy about being the most popular kid in class\nthat day. But looking back now, I see the intention and the heart behind it, but I also see the\nwrongness of it.

I write, I read, I code, I create, and I research about adoption and about China to try to make sense of it all. I have this fantasy that one day I\u2019ll have written hundreds of peer-reviewed journals, been featured in the most renowned exhibitions, and produced the most ground-breaking research for all my family, friends, colleagues, past lovers, and enemies to see, and that when that day comes, they will finally see me, and I will be happy. I\\u2019m beginning to realize that perhaps deep down I chase this fantasy to cope with the things I am too afraid to feel. \\n\\nBut sometimes, no amount of thinking can mend the pain, suffering, and heartbreak that being an adoptee is. It doesn\u2019t explain why I sometimes pray to every god I know begging for a reshuffling of the cards I\u2019ve been dealt. It doesn\u2019t explain how adoption makes me feel simultaneously confused, grounded, stupid, smart, ugly, beautiful, ashamed, and proud all at once. I thought I knew what would make me happy-what would heal me-but actually, I don\u2019t have the slightest idea. At this year\u2019s symposium, I asked myself to feel all of these things, without reaching into my back pocket of terminologies and APA citations for help. I sobbed, I laughed, I told stories. I allowed myself to have fun, and I allowed myself to grieve. I felt the comfort of reconnecting with old friends and the joy of making new ones. I got angry at the world for tearing us apart and then thanked it for bringing us together. Like \u843d\u53f6\u5f52\u6839 suggests, I let myself fall and flow with the wind. I let myself hit the ground. I let myself wither and seep into the soil. For once, I stop fighting and let gravity take over. I rest.",

Once these boxes have been ticked, criticism towards the adoptive parent and their methods ought to be completely out of line and seen as a sign of \u201cdisrespect\u201d or \u201cungratefulness\u201d. \n\nThis is not to say that I didn\u2019t meet this expectation, I did very much so fit into this box, especially growing up. \n\nBut as I grow older and I begin to have thoughts and experiences that they could never even imagine, suddenly that unconditional support I felt as a kid, is no longer there.\n\nI feel myself drifting farther and farther apart from my parents, and I \nThe rose tinted glasses have come off, and I\u2019ve grown to see my parents as not the perfect adoptive parents I once believed they were. But that is okay. We as adoptees need to realize that no matter how much we want to deny and avoid it, no matter how much we tell ourselves and those around us that yes, these Are are real parents and we wouldn\u2019t trade them for the world, that there is always going to be a disconnect, a strain in our relationship that biological children will NEVER experience with their parents. It\u2019s a feeling of unfamiliarity, of betrayal that the people you love so much might not be able to support your identity in the way that you wish. It\u2019s that pit in your stomach that forms when you come home after months or years and feel like you are talking to strangers.\n\n\nYou still feel alone because it\u2019s your own parents, the one two people in your life who you love and care for with all your heart, have betrayed you, by exhisting as white parents and refusing to acknowledge that their whiteness could and will harm their child. With zero ties to you or your heritage, it feels like betrayal when my parents chose to live in absolutely bum fuck no where, to send me to a private school with all white kids, to only be surrounded by their white-collar friends who were all white, who were all doctors, and who all had white, privileged kids. \n",

Even watching from afar on social media, I see how I identify less and less with my hometown and more with the people around me (who also look more like me). I think being an adoptee has at times definitely made it hard feeling close to Asian or Chinese-American culture because I didn\u2019t grow up in Asian environments. I didn\u2019t have Asian family members, so some of the commonalities many Asians have I feel left out of. Still, I look Chinese and when a stranger sees me at first glance, they don\u2019t  know my upbringing or background, so I am subject to discrimination just like any other Asian looking person, so there is some solidarity in that. I may have different life experiences than other Asians, but there is still a strong sense of Chineseness or Asianness that can\u2019t be stripped away even though I am adopted.",

    "title": "My thoughts on 'being in the fog'",
    "text": "There are two main viewpoints on adoption. The first, more commonly understood one, is that adoption is the altruistic act of helping a child in need, giving them a better life than they would have had if they weren\u2019t adopted. This is what the adoption industry wants you to believe. This is what most people in your life want you to believe. This is what so many adoptive parents want you to believe. \n\tThe second viewpoint, is the one I would hope that by the end of reading this, you can come to terms with, which is that adoption is not an individual act of                                             mc , but a carefully calculated transaction of human capital, part of a larger, global network that is used as a tool of modern day colonialism and white supremacy. This is the perspective that no one wants to talk about. This is the perspective that gets people looking at you like you\u2019re crazy. This is the perspective that is so incredibly hard to digest. \n\tOf course, one could say that these two perspectives are the two extremes of a much wider, diverse, range of perspectives out there. It could be said that making sense of one\u2019s own adoption is as much as it is a rocky road as it is a spectrum, with the two extremes being on either end of it. The unfortunate thing is, while I would love for revery adoptee out there to be able to understand how turbulent, traumatic, and inherently problematic adoption is, it\u2019s an opinion that most consider too radical to even consider. Not every adoptee will reach this point ever in their life, and if they do, there\u2019s no telling how long it will take. Moreover, there are so many factors that play into the likelihood and the timeframe of an adoptee\u2019s journey out of The Fog. For example, the town in which one grew up in, how open one\u2019s parents are about adoption, their relationship and proximity to other Chinese people, their knowledge of adoption, are just some of the many factors that play a role in an adoptee\u2019s discovery of their past. Of course, I also strongly believe that it also has to do with the personality of an adoptee, regardless of external factors. All adoptees, just like non-adoptees, are so different from one another, and will have different experiences no matter what. \n\tIn my experience, I grew up with parents who, for the most part, were incredibly supportive of who I was as an adoptee. They took me to Chinese school, let me learn Chinese, travelled with me to China, etc. Whether they\u2019ve been able to accept the responsibility and take restorative action for the trauma they have caused me\u2014that\u2019s a different story that I discuss in a different chapter. Though all in all, I would say I finally got out of being in the fog when I was a freshman in college, and since then, I\u2019ve been constantly reflecting on, criticizing, researching, and questioning my upbringing, trying to realign my past and present so that I can continue to work through the trauma in my life. \n",

And while this blanket statement was helpful during my adolescence when I was constantly dealing with people asking me with a condescending glare, \u201cwho are your REAL parents?\u201d, now this type of rhetoric seems to do more harm than good. Because as you grow older you begin to be able to formulate and vocalize real, objective opinions about your parents; you gain a valuable perspective on the type of people your parents are, their values and morals. However, being adopted and coming from a relatively healthy childhood complicates this, because even now, though I\u2019m able to critically examine where my parents have \u201cgone wrong\u201d \u2014 not only as parents but as ADOPTIVE parents \u2014 , I find myself feeling guilty for having such opinions, because I\u2019ve been conditioned my whole life to believe that these are in fact my real parents and I should be eternally grateful for that. And so at almost 21 years old I\u2019m grappling with the reality that my parents and I view the world very differently\u2014socially, politically\u2014and a large part of that has to do with me being adopted, and a large part of me struggling to come to terms with that is the expectations that are set for adoptive parents and their children.
